We hope this initial [#chilli4change](https://twitter.com/hippiehacker/status/773276669020778497) provides a forum for a _heated_ discussion of innovation around an (optionally) spicy meal brought to you by [ii](http://blog.ii.delivery).

ii wants to help [Tactile Astronomy](https://twitter.com/tactileedu/status/772705366891048960) provide a tactile experience of the heavens to blind youth

We look forward to a *heated discussion* over a meal of Texas Vegan Chilli.

```
Noon Friday 9th of September
148 Durham Street, Tauranga, NZ
```
We hope to do this again. To collaboratively fund the next event,
there will be koha buckets for chilli based food dishes from other cultures. (in addition to help host the next speaker)
