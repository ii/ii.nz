APISnoop is a site that tracks the progress of the Kubernetes conformance
project by analyzing the audit logs from end-to-end test runs, to see how many
conformant endpoints are hit by conformance tests. Our team used postgres and
svelte to build APISnoop, and the site is used by the larger Kubernetes community to set priorities for conformance work and reduce the creation of technical debt.
