We work with the [[https://cncf.io][CNCF]] to help ensure consistent features for Kubernetes across
vendor offerings and open source implementations. Our work includes tracking
conformance progress with audit log analysis, gitops bots that verify
conformance submissions, writing tests to increae conformance coverage, and
release-informaing bots that help ensure no new Kubernetes endpoints are added without
tests.
